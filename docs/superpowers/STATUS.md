# STATUS

_Updated: 2026-09-29 (T04)_

## Where we are
**T04 done** — subsystems 1 and 3 are implemented and verified running.
* `catalog-service`: 17 integration tests green; REST and direct psql both read the same rows.
* `billing-service`: 16 tests green (5 VAT unit + 11 SOAP integration over a real HTTP port);
  a raw `curl` SOAP POST against the running jar returns a proper `getInvoicesResponse`, and the
  generated WSDL advertises all seven operations.

## Environment facts verified this session
* Java 21.0.10, Maven 3.9.11, Docker 29.3.1 + compose v5.1.1, psql client 16.13.
* The Docker daemon is **not running at container start** — start it with
  `nohup dockerd > /tmp/dockerd.log 2>&1 &` and wait ~8s.
* Maven Central reachable. Docker Hub reachable; already pulled:
  `postgres:16-alpine`, `stripe/stripe-mock:latest`, `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-jammy`.
* No Conductor/crewmarshal plugin is installed (`ListPlugins` -> empty), so the workflow
  discipline is followed manually: plan -> task -> implement -> verify by running -> commit/push.
* Sonatype `repo1.maven.org` rate-limits raw `curl` metadata queries; let Maven resolve instead.

## Stack decisions validated by actually running them
* Spring Boot **3.5.6**, Java 21, Maven reactor with 6 modules.
* Flowable **7.2.0** (`flowable-spring-boot-starter-process`) works with Spring Boot 3.5.6 —
  smoke-tested a process with a waiting `intermediateCatchEvent` + `messageEventReceived`
  correlation on H2 and it completed. This is the async/correlation mechanism subsystem 2 needs.
* `com.stripe:stripe-java` **29.4.0**, Testcontainers **1.21.3** resolve from Maven Central.
* Two build traps, both already fixed in the parent POM - do not undo them:
  1. `spring-boot-maven-plugin:repackage` must use `<classifier>app</classifier>`. Without it the
     fat jar replaces the module's main artifact and Failsafe puts it on the test classpath, where
     the classes sit under `BOOT-INF/classes` and are invisible (`NoClassDefFoundError` at test
     discovery). The runnable jar is therefore `target/<module>-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-app.jar`.
  2. Testcontainers' bundled docker-java negotiates Docker Engine API **1.32**, which Docker 25+
     refuses ("client version 1.32 is too old"). Failsafe passes
     `-Dapi.version=${docker.api.version}` (default `1.44`) to fix it.
* Tests split by name: `*Test` = fast unit tests (`mvn test`), `*IT` = integration tests needing
  Docker/Postgres/Flowable (`mvn verify`, via Failsafe). **Use `mvn verify`, not `mvn test`.**

## Half-done
Nothing. The module POMs currently carry only the dependencies needed so far; each task adds its own.

## Findings worth keeping
* The gross/net VAT seam produces a **real, measurable rounding artefact**. Of the nine seeded
  plan prices, seven survive gross -> net -> gross unchanged, `MOB-VOICE-0010` gains one fillér
  (5990.00 -> 5990.01) and `INET-FIB-1000` loses one (17990.00 -> 17989.99). This is pinned by
  `VatCalculatorTest.theRoundTripErrorAcrossTheWholeSeededCatalogIsExactlyThis` and is the
  headline example for `docs/semantic-mismatches.md`. Do not "fix" it without updating both.
* The billing SOAP contract already declares all seven operations (`startPayment`,
  `exportPaymentBatch`, `listUnconfirmedBatches`, `getPaymentBatch`, `reconcileBatch` are in the
  XSD/WSDL but not yet implemented in `BillingEndpoint`); T05 and T06 fill them in.
* `nillable="true"` on an `xs:int` makes xjc generate `JAXBElement<Integer>`; use plain
  `minOccurs="0"` for an optional int.

## Next action
T05: `stripe-sim` module plus the `StripeGateway` in billing — implement the `startPayment` SOAP
operation and the Stripe payment-succeeded callback, wired to `stripe/stripe-mock` in Docker and
to `stripe-sim` locally.

## Branch note
Work happens on `feat/legacy-system` (as requested). The harness-designated branch
`claude/busy-cray-97xi8a` is kept fast-forwarded to the same head so both instructions hold.
